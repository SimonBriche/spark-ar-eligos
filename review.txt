This effect needs to detect up to 2 faces. Once detected, the face is being "RGB-shifted" (but not the entire screen) at random pace, except for the nose and mouth. This is mostly a tribute to Eligos, a demon from the TV show "Ash vs. Evil Dead", but without the "devil" part (scary bloody predator-like teeth) to be used by the thirteen years old audience of Instagram. As a result, it's a funny effect that could spin your head a little bit :)
